                        <p>Viewing the trends of the Data Analytics field through the lens of its history gives insight into the skills and experience that are most sought after as well as the companies and geographic areas which offer the best salaries and employment conditions.</p>
                        <p>The use of analytics by business can be found as far back as the 19th century when Frederick Winslow Taylor initiated time management exercises to improve industrial efficiency. In the late 1930s, analytics began receiving more attention as computers became decision-making support systems. Data analytics has evolved significantly with the development of big data, data warehouses, and a variety of software and hardware.</p>
                        <p>The development of relational databases in the 1970s and non-relational databases with the advancement of the internet in the 1990s ushered in the era of "Big Data" and a new frontier for employment opportunities in data analytics. The origin of the modern data analyst was born out of the use case demands of the internet. Over the past 10 years, the need for data analysts has grown exponentially as more people and companies expand their exposure to the internet.</p>

                            <p>There are several factors that influence salary for data analysts. In general, with a range of $50,000 to $120,000 per year, the average data analyst salary sits at $77,110, according to Indeed.com. </p>
                            <p>Experience matters as well. New analysts can expect on average, $73,000, which rises to $81,600 with 3 to 5 years, and $91,200 with 10 plus years of experience.</p>
                            <p>High earning analysts prioritize their skills, and depending on the industry, certain skills will be compensated more than others. Across the board, SQL and Excel are probably most important. Next in line is a statistical language such as Python or R.</p>
                            <p>Analysts strong in statistics and probability, such as math majors, will be in demand, since this kind of processing and organization builds into the bread and butter of data analysis, visualization. Whether through Python or Business Intelligence programs such as PowerBI or Tableau, data can and should tell as story.</p>
                            <p>Demand for skilled data analysts is growing — the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs 2020 report listed this career as number one in terms of increasing demand. </p>
                            <p>Not to be overlooked, there are common benefits to the position. Most companies hiring data analysts will have comfortable office space, or remote work, and with those usually comes benefits. Analysts can expect 401(k), employee stock purchase plan, a range of health and dental insurance, tuition reimbursement, and the list goes on.</p>
